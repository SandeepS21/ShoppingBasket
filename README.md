Few guidelines:

·         Junit test cases are must and make sure that it has nearly 90-100% code coverage.

·         Your code should be of standard production ready

·         Code should be clean and self-descriptive.

·         They don’t  expect much Javadoc, however, good to have on important methods.

·         This is program test and they don’t expect you to write whole framework with logging and all. So keep it simple. Ideally you should not spend more than 2 hours for same with Junit test cases.

.       Handle the proper exception.

.     main method not require.
